# NoHaX
NoHaX is a covert, autonomous cryptocurrency mining daemon engineered for persistence and stealth. Designed to run silently in the background as a Unix daemon, it downloads and launches the latest stable build of XMRig from a trusted upstream source, targeting Monero pools with TLS encryption for obfuscation.
